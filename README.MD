An "Attempt" at writing a working standard library in C++


This accommodates all of the bad practices i have gotten used to while learning C++.
Documentation can be found in the Documentation directory, 
where each .hpp file has a corresponding .doc file.
Documentation will only be written when i want to, so it may (very likely) be out of date.
